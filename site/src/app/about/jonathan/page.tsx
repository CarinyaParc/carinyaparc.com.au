              <p className="mt-6 text-xl/8 text-charcoal-600">
                Founder and Steward of Carinya Parc and Transformation Lead at Temple & Webster,
                Australia's leading e-commerce retailer. With over two decades of experience in
                top-tier strategy consulting and industry leadership, Jonathan has driven
                large-scale digital transformation and strategic growth across financial services,
                retail, e-commerce and beyond.

              <p className="mt-6 text-xl/8 text-gray-600">
                For twenty years, Jonathan dreamed of swapping boardrooms for back paddocks. In
                early 2024, he acted on that vision—applying corporate-grade rigor to ecological
                restoration.
              </p>
              <p className="mt-6 text-base/7 text-gray-600">
                Fourteen years ago, Jonathan surprised the world—and himself—by earning a place as a
                MasterChef finalist. That experience ignited his passion for hands-on problem
                solving and lifelong learning. Since then, he's continued to balance his strategic
                consulting career with culinary pursuits, even honing his skills during weekends at
                Gordon Ramsay's Petrus in London while maintaining a full-time corporate role.

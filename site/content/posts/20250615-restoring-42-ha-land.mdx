Carinya Parc's journey from degraded pasture to thriving ecosystem began in early 2024. In this article, we'll walk you through:

1. **Site assessment & planning**: how we mapped soil types, contours and existing remnant vegetation.
2. **Zone-based interventions**: our five ecological zones (A–E) and their specific restoration tactics.
3. **Agroforestry trials**: lessons learned from syntropic guild plantings and cover-crop rotations.
4. **Riparian rehabilitation**: techniques for stabilising riverbanks and improving water quality along the Branch River.

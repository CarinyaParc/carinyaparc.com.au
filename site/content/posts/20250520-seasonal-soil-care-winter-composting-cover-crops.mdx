Winter months provide a crucial opportunity for soil regeneration at Carinya Parc. Our seasonal soil building strategy includes:

1. **Winter Composting:** How we adjust our compost recipe for slower cold-weather decomposition while maximizing microbial diversity.
2. **Cold-Season Cover Crops:** Our selection of hardy legumes and grasses that continue to build soil even in cooler temperatures.
3. **Strategic Application:** Where and when we apply compost for maximum benefit across different growing zones.
4. **Monitoring Methods:** The simple tests we use to track soil improvements over time.

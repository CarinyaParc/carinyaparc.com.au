When we first began reforesting and trialling syntropic guilds at Carinya Parc, not everything went to plan. In this post, we explore:

1. **Planting Errors:** What we learned from selecting the wrong species for certain soil types and how we adapted our nursery mix.
2. **Grazing Missteps:** How over-rotation and poor timing impacted pasture health—and the corrective measures we implemented.
3. **Management Hiccups:** Lessons from volunteer coordination and equipment failures, with tips on process improvement.
4. **Resilience in Action:** How embracing setbacks has made our team—and our land—more robust over time.

After months of research, planning, and testing, we're excited to share our framework for designing climate-appropriate polyculture systems at Carinya Parc. This article covers:

1. **Climate Analysis:** Understanding our specific rainfall patterns, temperature extremes, and microclimate variations.
2. **Plant Selection:** The matrix we've developed for choosing compatible species based on root depth, nutrient needs, and growth habits.
3. **Establishment Protocol:** Our step-by-step process for preparing soil, planting sequences, and initial management.
4. **Monitoring Framework:** The key indicators we track to evaluate system health and productivity.

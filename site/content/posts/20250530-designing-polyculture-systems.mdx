Polyculture is the heart of our agroforestry trials. In this guide, you’ll find:

1. **Guild Selection:** Criteria for choosing compatible fruit, nut and timber species.
2. **Layer Planning:** How to position canopy, understory, groundcover and root crops for maximum synergy.
3. **Soil Preparation:** Techniques for building fertility before planting.
4. **Maintenance Routines:** Watering, mulching and companion planting strategies.

# Regeneration: Building Biodiversity and Healing Country

At Carinya Parc, regeneration isn't just what we do—it's who we are. We're actively restoring 42 hectares of former grazing land into vibrant, connected ecosystems that support native wildlife, sequester carbon, build soil health, and produce nutrient-dense food through nature-positive methods.

> "Working with nature, not against it. Building soil health from the ground up."

## Why Does Regeneration Matter?

Our approach to regeneration addresses multiple interconnected challenges:

- **Biodiversity Loss:** Creating habitat for threatened species including koalas and gliders
- **Carbon Sequestration:** Building soil organic matter to draw down atmospheric carbon
- **Water Cycle Repair:** Improving infiltration, retention and filtration of rainfall
- **Food Security:** Demonstrating how productive agriculture can enhance ecosystems
- **Community Wellbeing:** Providing spaces for connection, learning and participation

Through thoughtful design and implementation, we're showing how human activity can be a positive force for ecological restoration.

## What Are Our Regeneration Goals?

### 1. Native Habitat Restoration

Planting 30,000+ native trees and shrubs to rebuild forest structure and establish wildlife corridors connecting fragmented habitat across the landscape.

### 2. Riparian Zone Revitalisation

Stabilising riverbanks, filtering agricultural runoff and enhancing water quality along our 400 metres of Branch River frontage.

### 3. Syntropic Agroforestry Development

Designing and establishing multi-layer plant guilds that combine fruit, nut and timber species with understory vegetables, herbs and beneficial cover crops.

### 4. Soil Health & Carbon Building

Measuring and improving soil organic matter, microbial diversity and carbon sequestration using regenerative grazing, cover cropping and plant succession.

### 5. Biodiversity Monitoring

Tracking the return of native species through quarterly surveys, photo points, and camera-trap networks to document our ecological impact.

## How Are We Approaching Different Areas?

Our property is divided into strategic ecological zones, each with specific focus areas and timelines:

| Zone | Focus                             | Priority | Timeline  | Current Status |
| :--: | :-------------------------------- | :------- | :-------- | :------------- |
|  A   | Forest Enhancement & Firebreak    | 3        | 2025–2026 | Planning       |
|  B   | Wildlife Corridor & Koala Habitat | 1        | 2025–2026 | Site prep      |
|  C   | Native Avenue & Bush Food Trials  | –        | 2026–2027 | Research       |
|  D   | Agroforestry & Food Production    | 2        | 2026+     | Design         |
|  E   | Riparian & Wetland Restoration    | –        | 2027+     | Baseline data  |

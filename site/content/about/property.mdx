# The Property

**Address:** 315 Warraba Road, The Branch, NSW 2425  
**Size:** 42 ha (102 acres)

## History

Carinya Parc was originally an alpaca and cattle farm. In early 2024, the property entered a deliberate rest period to allow natural regeneration following decades of grazing. Today, we’re transforming tired pastures into a mosaic of native forest, agroforestry plots and sustainable agricultural enterprises.

## Our Regeneration Plan

We are planting over 30 000 native trees and shrubs across five ecological zones (A–E), each tailored to habitat restoration, agroforestry trials and food-production systems. Monitoring stations track soil health, water quality and biodiversity return—ensuring every hectare moves closer to its natural potential.

# Slow-Roasted Dexter Beef with Root Vegetables

> A hearty roast that lets our grass-fed Dexter beef shine alongside caramelised root veg.

1. **Preheat oven:** 140 °C (fan-forced).
2. **Season beef:** Rub roast with olive oil, salt, pepper, rosemary and garlic.
3. **Roast:** Place beef on a rack over a roasting tray. Scatter root vegetables below. Roast for 3 hours until internal temperature reaches 60 °C for medium-rare.
4. **Rest:** Transfer beef to a plate, cover loosely with foil, and rest for 15 minutes.
5. **Serve:** Slice beef thinly and arrange with roasted root veg. Spoon pan juices over the top.

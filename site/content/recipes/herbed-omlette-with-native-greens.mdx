# Herbed Omelette with Native Greens

> A simple, flavour-packed omelette that celebrates Carinya Parc’s pasture-raised eggs and local bush tucker.

1. **Prep the greens:** Wash and loosely chop native greens; pat dry.
2. **Whisk eggs:** In a bowl, beat eggs with a pinch of salt and pepper.
3. **Cook:** Melt butter in a non-stick pan over medium heat. Add greens and sauté for 1–2 minutes until just wilted. Pour in eggs.
4. **Finish:** Lift edges as eggs set, tilting pan to cook evenly. Fold omelette in half and slide onto a plate.

Enjoy immediately with a scattering of fresh herbs.

## Can You Share or Gain Knowledge?

### Our Mentorship Program

Knowledge exchange is central to building regenerative systems. Our mentorship program connects experienced practitioners with those eager to learn:

### For Mentors

Do you have expertise in soil health, permaculture design, small-scale farming or marketing? Share your knowledge with the next generation of land stewards through structured relationships and skill-sharing events.

### For Mentees

Are you seeking hands-on experience in regenerative agriculture? Our small-plot lease program (1–5 acres) provides access to land, infrastructure and guidance—an ideal stepping stone for aspiring farmers.

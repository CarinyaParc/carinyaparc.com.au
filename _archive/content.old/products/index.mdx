# Nourishing Food from Regenerative Land

At Carinya Parc, we believe that how food is produced matters just as much as how it tastes. We're laying the groundwork now so that, in time, our paddocks and food forests will yield nutrient-dense, ethically raised products that connect you directly to our regenerative landscape.

While we're focused on land regeneration first, here's what we're working toward:

## What Will We Produce?

### Pasture-Raised Eggs

- **Heritage Breeds:**

  - Heritage Isa Browns as our foundation flock
  - Future conservation of rare Australian breeds
- **Production Approach:**
  - Mobile chicken tractors following planned grazing patterns
  - Flocks of 200-250 hens in multiple small, manageable groups
  - Supplemented with locally-sourced organic grain
- **Expected Launch:** Mid-2026

### Heritage Poultry

- **Ethical Approach:**
  - Free-range birds raised to proper maturity (10-12 weeks)
  - Mobile shelter systems for soil improvement and bird health
  - Respectful end-of-life management for retired laying hens
- **Product Range:**
  - Seasonal meat birds for exceptional flavour
  - Stewing hens with superior nutrient density
  - Bone broth and value-added products

## How Does Regenerative Production Make a Difference?

What sets our future products apart isn't just about animal welfare—it's about how our production methods actively restore ecosystem health:

1. **Building Living Soil:** Our animals and plants work together in planned sequences to increase organic matter and soil microbial life.

2. **Supporting Biodiversity:** Our production areas incorporate habitat for beneficial insects, native birds and soil organisms that create natural resilience.

3. **Improving Water Cycles:** Regenerative management increases water infiltration and retention, reducing runoff and enhancing drought resilience.

4. **Sequestering Carbon:** Through photosynthesis and careful management, our production systems help draw down atmospheric carbon into soil and plants.

5. **Creating Community Connection:** Every purchase will support ongoing restoration work and provide opportunities for education and engagement.
